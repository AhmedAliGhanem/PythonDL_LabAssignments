1. Reading the file..
---------------------

Python is a widely used high level programming language for general purpose programming. Features dynamic type system with automatic memory management. Python supports multiple
programming paradigms. Includes object-oriented, imperative, functional programs, procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library. At UMKC, this falls under
course number CS5590. You should have understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. Basic knowledge of any language is good. Code developed by Avni Mehta.
